# capstone_parking_lot

A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

This project is a Flutter mobile application that can be run multiplatform on both android and ios devices. The app receives information from a server implemented
using Node.js that contains information detailing where in a parking lot available parking spaces are. The information about the parking lots is recieved from a
raspberry pi microcomputer with attached camera module. 

The mobile app portion was created to give users functionality and easy access to information that will assist in their parking experience.
